## How to start

- Create Azure Databricks resource in [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/).<br>
  After the resource is created, launch Databricks workspace UI by clicking "Launch Workspace".
- Create a compute (cluster) in Databricks UI. (Select "Compute" menu and proceed.)<br>
Databricks **Runtime Version 10.2 ML or above** is recommended for this tutorial.
- Download [HandsOn.dbc](https://github.com/tsmatz/azure-databricks-exercise/raw/master/HandsOn.dbc) and import into your workspace as follows.
    - Select "Workspace" in Workspace UI.
    - Go to user folder, click your e-mail (the arrow icon), and then select "import" command.
    - Pick up ```HandsOn.dbc``` to import.
- Open notebook and attach above compute (your cluster) in every notebook. (Select compute on the top of each notebook.)
- Please run "Exercise 01 : Storage Settings (Prepare)" notebook first, before running other notebooks.

> Note : You cannot use Azure trial (free) subscription, because of the limited quota. Please promote to pay-as-you-go when you're in Azure free subscription. (The credit will be reserved, even when you transit to pay-as-you-go.)
