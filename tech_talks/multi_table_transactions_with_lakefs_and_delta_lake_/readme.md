2021-08-31 | [Watch the video](https://youtu.be/6nfubcBL8P4) | This folder contains the notebooks used in this session.

Join us for a tech talk about LakeFS and Delta Lake. Paul Singman from Treeverse and Denny Lee from Databricks will discuss multi-table transactions with LakeFS and Delta Lake.

LakeFS enables you to manage your data lake the way you manage your code, allowing for a collaborative development environment and CI/CD deployment of data. Delta Lake is an open-source project that enables building a Lakehouse architecture on top of existing storage systems such as S3, ADLS, GCS, and HDFS. In this session, Paul and Denny will discuss LakeFS and Delta Lake and the integration of LakeFS and Delta Lake simplifies your multi-table pipelines.
