Tech talk title: "Data Collab Lab | A Foray into Nested Data using Spark SQL and Dark Chocolate" <br>
Date: April 13, 2021

For many of us, including data analysts and data scientists alike, nested data is often our least favorite type of data since it can be challenging and time-consuming to wrangle. In this workshop, we distill foundational concepts about two common types of nested columns: arrays and structs. Using SQL Analytics, we will be exploring a dataset curated by the Manhattan Chocolate Society on dark chocolate with varying flavors, ratings, and places of origin. You will come away from this workshop armed with knowledge about how to create nested data from flat data, manipulate and conduct aggregate calculations on nested columns; and also perhaps more importantly, about chocolate!

This workshop is geared towards an audience who has basic SQL knowledge or above.
