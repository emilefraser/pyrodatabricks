Join us for a three part learning series: *Introduction to Data Analysis for Aspiring Data Scientists*. This is the second of three (maybe four, depending on what you all think!) online workshops for anyone and everyone interested in learning about data analysis. No previous programming experience required.

**Part 2: Data Analysis with pandas**

Abstract: This workshop is on pandas, a powerful open-source Python package for data analysis and manipulation. In this workshop, you will learn how to read data, compute summary statistics, check data distributions, conduct basic data cleaning and transformation, and plot simple visualizations. We will be using data released by the [Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Prior basic Python experience is recommended.

Who should attend this workshop: Anyone and everyone, CS students and even non-technical folks are welcome to join. Please note, prior basic Python experience is recommended.

What you need: Although no prep work is required, we do recommend basic python knowledge.
