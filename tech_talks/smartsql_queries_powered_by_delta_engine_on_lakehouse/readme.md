Welcome to the Data Collab Lab with Franco and Denny! This online meetup series brings together various data experts and we collaborate together to (hopefully) solve the problem!

For this session, we will discuss: [SmartSQL Queries powered by Delta Engine on Lakehouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCVyk8npl-k)

As a data analyst have you ever wanted to be able to simply add some Machine Learning capabilities into your SQL Query? Does your database engine require additional laborious steps in order to leverage Python or R functionality for your data scientist to work on? Do you feel that your teams are siloed from each other preventing you from getting the most out of your data? Join us while we work together to build machine learning algorithms into simple functions that our data analysts can use to build smarts into their analytics.
