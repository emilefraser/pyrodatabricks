Join us for a three part learning series: *Introduction to Data Analysis for Aspiring Data Scientists*. This is the first of three (maybe four, depending on what you all think!) online workshops for anyone and everyone interested in learning about data analysis. No previous programming experience required.

**Part 1: Intro to Python on Databricks**

Abstract: This workshop will show you the simple steps needed to program in Python using a notebook environment on the free Databricks Community Edition. Python is a popular programming language because of its wide applications including but not limited to data analysis, machine learning, and web development. This workshop covers major foundational concepts necessary for you to start coding in Python, with a focus on data analysis. You will learn about different types of variables, for loops, functions, and conditional statements. No prior programming knowledge is required.

Who should attend this workshop: Anyone and everyone, CS students and even non-technical folks are welcome to join. No prior programming knowledge is required. Please note, If you have taken Python courses in the past, this may be too introductory for you.

What you need: No prep work is required. Weâ€™ll make sure that you have all the resources to get you started during the workshop. Come ready to learn about Python!
