Apache Spark™️ has become the de-facto open-source standard for big data processing due to its ease of use and performance. And the open-source Delta Lake project enhances Spark’s lead with new capabilities like ACID transactions, Schema Enforcement and Time Travel. These features help ensure that data lakes and data pipelines can deliver high-quality, reliable data to downstream data teams for successful data analytics and machine learning projects.

In this tech talk, we will discuss the top tuning tips for Apache Spark 3.0 and Delta Lake on Databricks. Come prepared to ask your questions and join Joe Widen, Chris Hoshino-Fish, and Denny Lee to discuss when to use which join operations, how to pick your machine sizes, how to help speed up your merge operations, and how to make your jobs easier!
