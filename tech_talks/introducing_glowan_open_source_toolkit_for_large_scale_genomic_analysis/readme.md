Glow is an open-source toolkit used in population genetics. The project is an industry collaboration between Databricks and the Regeneron Genetics Center. Our mission is to bridge bioinformatics and data science, by integrating it into the Apache Spark ecosystem. Spark is the de facto standard for data science in industry, and is used by every major tech company. By bringing these two fields together, Glow is enabling engineers and scientists to work together effectively to scale genomics data analytics to population levels.
