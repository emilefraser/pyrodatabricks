# List of TODOs to fix in [ScaDaMaLe Book](https://lamastex.github.io/ScaDaMaLe)
 Some of these are fundamentally unresolvable without a lot of work...

We are now trying mdbook and avoiding JupyterBook.

The real work is done here on issues raised:

- [https://gitlab.com/tilowiklund/pinot/-/issues](https://gitlab.com/tilowiklund/pinot/-/issues)

## Needs Fixing next

- images not linked by students to their own github repos as strongly recommended
  - this requires manual downloads by Raaz into `extra-resources-student-projects/...`
  - under progress


## Partiall Fixed

- ~~latex inline done~~ mostly
- ~~html inline done~~ mostly
- proper markdown needs to be followed by notebook authors (databricks does a lot of slopy markdown fielding in its notebooks)

## Jens' Fix-It List:

- ~~I would also suggest that you temporarily add a page to the book with a timestamp for when the output was generated, and a list of to-dos, so everyone knows the progress.~~

#### Feedback for html version (possibly better solved in conversion script rather than in notebook)

- ~~% intro is stripped from code cells. They are not irrelevant. See "%sh".~~
- ~~The "default language" of the workbook should be mentioned somewhere. If it's mentioned elsewehere that everything is Scala, go for that and mark the exceptions, or let each workbook or cell mention language.~~ 
  - Raaz: each cell's language is being extracted (syntax hghlighting per language is in progress)
- ~~Long output is boxed in Databricks, not in book.~~
  - https://jupyterbook.org/content/code-outputs.html#scrolling-cell-outputs
  - Raaz: currently manually truncated... 
  - Raaz: but scrollable option in progress
- Plain URLs are not links in book. Make that markup instead?
  - Raaz: Yes, please make plain URLs markdown properly eg., replace `http://blablablah` by `[http://blablablah](http://blablablah)`
- ~~Plain URLs should not be treated as markdown (Preserve _ * # etc.)~~
  - Raaz: See above comment. Make URLs properly marked-down.
- Code output from "display()" becomes [TABLE] only.
  - Raaz: This is in progress.
- "Before we begin filtering" md doesn't produce the numbered list correctly. And "Clean xml and markup".
  - This is because databricks md is generous. Standard markdown expects an EOL character above the beginning of list. So replace 

```Before we begin filtering the contents of pages, we want to discard 
 1. Pages that are redirects, i.e., pages containing a `<redirect_title="...">` tag
 1. Non-articles, i.e., pages not in namespace 0 (not containing `<ns>0</ns>`)
 1. Any page containing the macro tag stating that it was generated by a robot.
```

- ~~html image link fails. See "Smoothed LDA". Make that markup instead?~~
  - Raaz: inline html is fine now. Perhaps add an extra line between image and its source citation, say by replacing the following with its successor.

- Should not color code in //-comments.
  - Raaz: In progress as one needs to finf language-specific highlighting in JupyterBook whcih defaults to Python... if not easy all highlighting will be removed.
- The runtime duration is not included in the html book. Since the topic is sometimes efficient pipelines, it would be nice to include it (but not the "by").
  - this information fielding is beyond the scope of the book. You are welcome to mention the time taken in a markdown cell and mention at the top the type of cluster under the hood. However, the accompanying databricks notebooks as importable html notebooks into databricks community edition ot another shard will have some of this information preserved.
- The video link is temporary. I think the workbook stands fine without it.
  - Please leave the video links for a little while longer so academic review can happen when the book is slightly more presentable.

#### Feedback for html version (possibly better solved in conversion script rather than in notebook)

- ~~```Latex style K_n shows verbatim in (Chrome) on Databricks and like "graph K∗n and the structure of the “ratbrain*graph”" in html book.``~~`
  -  ~~```structure of the graph $K_n$ and the structure of the "rat_brain_graph".```~~
- ~~Should not color code in comments. A very relevant question is if this graph is connected. If it is not~~
  - Raaz: see points earlier.

#### Feedback on proof-reading

- "Application" should not be first-level header.
- Use a constant for path (helps other reuse and you can anonymize it for publication if you want)
  - "/FileStore/shared_uploads/petterre@kth.se/"
- Proof-read for spelling.

#### Feedback for html version (possibly better solved in conversion script rather than in notebook)

- Numbered headers aren't detected as headers.
  - Raaz: These should be changed to regular headers. If this is itemized number list then an EOL has to be added before the numbering begins (see comment above)
- ~~Latex style formula shows fine in (Chrome) on Databricks but not in html.~~
- Interactive graphs show as [TABLE]. Static Graphs does show however.
