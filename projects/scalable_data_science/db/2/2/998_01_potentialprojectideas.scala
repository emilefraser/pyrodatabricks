// MAGIC 1. Exact Matrix Completion via Convex Optimization
// MAGIC  * **Abstract** 
// MAGIC     - Suppose that one observes an incomplete subset of entries selected from a low-rank matrix. When is it possible to complete the matrix and recover the entries that have not been seen? We demonstrate that in very general settings, one can perfectly recover all of the missing entries from most sufficiently large subsets by solving a convex programming problem that finds the matrix with the minimum nuclear norm agreeing with the observed entries. The techniques used in this analysis draw upon parallels in the field of compressed sensing, demonstrating that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information.

// MAGIC  * Natural Language Translation at the Intersection of AI and HCI
// MAGIC    * __Abstract__: The fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) are influencing each other like never before. Widely used systems such as Google Translate, Facebook Graph Search, and RelateIQ hide the complexity of large-scale AI systems behind intuitive interfaces. But relations were not always so auspicious. The two fields emerged at different points in the history of computer science, with different influences, ambitions, and attendant biases. AI aimed to construct a rival, and perhaps a successor, to the human intellect. Early AI researchers such as McCarthy, Minsky, and Shannon were mathematicians by training, so theorem-proving and formal models were attractive research directions. In contrast, HCI focused more on empirical approaches to usability and human factors, both of which generally aim to make machines more useful to humans. Many attendees at the first CHI conference in 1983 were psychologists and engineers. Presented papers had titles such as "Design Principles for Human-Computer Interfaces" and "Psychological Issues in the Use of Icons in Command Menus," hardly appealing fare for mainstream AI researchers. 
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC     Since the 1960s, HCI has often been ascendant when setbacks in AI occurred, with successes and failures in the two fields redirecting mindshare and research funding.14 Although early figures such as Allen Newell and Herbert Simon made fundamental contributions to both fields, the competition and relative lack of dialogue between AI and HCI are curious. Both fields are broadly concerned with the connection between machines and intelligent human agents. What has changed recently is the deployment and adoption of user-facing AI systems. These systems need interfaces, leading to natural meeting points between the two fields.

// MAGIC       * The latest scientific findings indicate that emotions play an essential role in decision making, perception, learning, and moreâ€”that is, they influence the very mechanisms of rational thinking. Not only too much, but too little emotion can impair decision making. According to Rosalind Picard, if we want computers to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have and express emotions.

// MAGIC          * __Abstract:__The interaction between human beings and computers will be more natural if computers are able to perceive and respond to human non-verbal communication such as emotions. Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered. Results also show the complementarily of the two modalities and that when these two modalities are fused, the performance and the robustness of the emotion recognition system improve measurably.

// MAGIC     * TensorFlow is a machine learning library created by the Brain Team researchers at Google and now open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. TensorFlow is detailed in the whitepaper TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems. The source code can be found on Google Git. It is a tool for writing and executing machine learning algorithms. Computations are done in a data flow graph where the nodes are mathematical operations and the edges are tensors (multidimensional data arrays) that are exchanged between nodes. An user constructs the graph and writes the algorithms that executed on each node. TensorFlow takes care of executing the code asynchronously on different devices, cores, and threads.... TensorFlow is used by Google for GMail (SmartReply), Search (RankBrain), Pictures (Inception Image Classification Model), Translator (Character Recognition), and other products.
