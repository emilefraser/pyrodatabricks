## key points
* started in 2011 with strong public-private funding
  * Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
  * Lawrance Berkeley Laboratory
  * National Science Foundation
  * Amazon Web Services
  * Google
  * SAP
* The Berkeley AMPLab is creating a new approach to data analytics to seamlessly integrate the three main resources available for making sense of data at scale: 
  * Algorithms (machine learning and statistical techniques), 
  * Machines (in the form of scalable clusters and elastic cloud computing), and 
  * People (both individually as analysts and in crowds). 
* The lab is realizing its ideas through the development of a freely-available Open Source software stack called BDAS: the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack. 
* Several components of BDAS have gained significant traction in industry and elsewhere, including: 
  * the Mesos cluster resource manager, 
  * the Spark in-memory computation framework, a sub-stack of the BDAS stack, 
  * and more...

## MapReduce and Apache Spark.
#### by Anthony Joseph in BerkeleyX/CS100.1x

* **(watch now 1:48)**: Map Reduce (is bounded by Disk I/O)

* SUMMARY
    * uses memory instead of disk alone and is thus fater than Hadoop MapReduce
    * resilience abstraction is by RDD (resilient distributed dataset)
    * RDDs can be recovered upon failures from their *lineage graphs*, the recipes to make them starting from raw data
    * Spark supports a lot more than MapReduce, including streaming, interactive in-memory querying, etc.
    * Spark demonstrated an unprecedented sort of 1 petabyte (1,000 terabytes) worth of data in 234 minutes running on 190 Amazon EC2 instances (in 2015).
    * Spark expertise corresponds to the highest Median Salary in the US (~ 150K)
