### Host

This event is hosted by [King's Digital Lab](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/King's%20Digital%20Lab).

### Facilitator

The workshop will be led by Raaz Sainudiin. Raaz completed a PhD in Statistics at Cornell University in 2005 and was a Research Fellow of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 at the Statistics Department of Oxford University until 2007. He is currently a Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at University of Canterbury, Christchurch, NZ. His recent excursions into scalable data science is funded by databricks academic partners program.

### Overview

This workshop will introduce elements of Scalable Data Science for humanities and social science researchers using Apache Spark over a Databricks shard. It will guide attendees through hands-on analysis of US State of the Union addresses, Wikipedia click-streams, live Tweets, and the Old Bailey Online dataset.

### What we'll do

The workshop will introduce the basics of the in-memory distributed computing framework Apache Spark, including basic map-reduce operations via Spark's resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) for a word-count of US State of the Union addresses (first 40 minutes), data exploration via no-sql queries using Spark's dataframes for Wiki click-streams (30-40 minutes), Spark-streaming for filtering and getting top hash-tags of live tweets (30-40 minutes) and finally the loading, xml-parsing and the beginnings of exploration of the Old Bailey Online dataset (40 minutes, including discussions). There will be a 20 minute break during the workshop.

### Who should attend?

Researchers in the humanities and social sciences who would like an introduction to big data analysis, using industry-standard tools. The workshop will be technical, and best suited to people with a good grasp of programming. More advanced users will be able to extend themselves. Non-programmers interested in seeing 'under the hood' of data analysis, perhaps in order to collaborate more effectively with technical colleagues, are also welcome.

### What you need to bring and do

Bring a laptop if you have one. Access to eduroam and The Cloud will be available. Ideally you will have signed up for a Databricks Community Edition account before the day so you can follow along.

Please get on the waiting list for Databricks Community Edition as soon as possible: [https://databricks.com/try-databricks](https://databricks.com/try-databricks).
